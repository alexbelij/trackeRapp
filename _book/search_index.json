It displays segments of each individual session on a plot with time of the day on the x-axis and date on the y-axis and the length of each segment represents the duration of the session. The workout timeline provides an athlete with valuable information on what times of the day they tend to train and for how long. The plot exposes changes in training patterns, such as changes in training times, frequency and duration. The ability to select sessions from the timeline plot allows the user to analyse, for example, evening sessions and morning sessions separately, as well as the user might be interested in analysing sessions within a specific time range. For example, Figure 1.2 illustrates the user selecting sessions between 14:30-18:00 and 1 - 13 June 2013. As shown in Figure 1.1, hovering over session segments displays the session number, start and end date to provide a more detailed description. Figure 1.1: Workout timeline Figure 1.2: Workout Timeline - sessions selected by date and time of the day 1.2 Summary table of selected sessions The summary table (Figure 1.3) displays the date, the start time, the end time, the duration and the sport of each session. Currently selected sessions are highlighted with a grey colour. In order to accommodate for large datasets, the table is scrollable with the ability to search for key values. Figure 1.3: Summary of Selected Sessions 1.3 Map The map (Figure 1.4) displays routes of all the currently selected sessions in a blue colour and currently selected sessions are highlighted with an orange colour. Hovering over a session displays a basic summary of the session as shown in Figure 1.4. The basic summary displays the session number, distance, duration, average pace of the session and also the current speed depending. Figure 1.4: Map 1.4 Session summaries plots The session summary plot in Figure 1.5 displays the scalar summaries of each session on a plot with date on the x-axis and the value on the y-axis. It also shows the current units of measurement on the y-axis. The plot enables the user to track their progress over time, identify changes in their training pattern or detect changes in intensity of their performance. Session summary values include: average speed, pace, power, cadence running, cadence cycling, and heart rate, where each variable is calculated over the time spent moving throughout the session. The summaries also include total distance covered, total duration, and work-to-rest ratio. See Frick and Kosmidis (2017) for detail on calculation of each variable and any mathematical formulae. The trackeRapp implements plots for all the scalar summaries and the user is able to select which variables to plot, where each selected variable is individually plotted in a separate box (Figure 1.5), providing a clear separation in the user interface. As shown in Figure 1.5, selected sessions are highlighted with an orange colour and hovering over an individual point displays the exact value, the date, the number and the sport of the session. Figure 1.5: Session summary plots for selected variables 1.5 Summary boxes of selected sessions The summary boxes (Figure 1.6) display the average values for the total distance covered, average duration, average pace and average heart rate for the selected sessions (note that all sessions are considered if none are selected). The boxes provide a tool for an instant analysis and gaining insights of training data in the selected training sessions. Figure 1.6: Summary boxes For example, the user might be interested in comparing their training results in the morning (6:00-10:00) and the afternoon (17:00-20:00), as displayed in Figures 1.7 and 1.8, respectively, by selecting sessions from the workout timeline plot. The user can right away see that the morning and afternoon workouts are quite similar in average distance, pace and heart rate and the afternoon workouts seem to have on average slightly higher average pace. Figure 1.7: Morning workouts Figure 1.8: Evening workouts 1.6 Individual sessions plots The plots of individual sessions (Figure 1.9) display the changes of a given variable over the course of the selected sessions, with x-axis representing the time and y-axis the value. The following variables can be displayed in the trackeRapp: heart rate, altitude, speed, cadence, power, pace, work-to-rest ratio. By plotting individual sessions the user is able to obtain a detailed insight into the evolution of a given variable throughout the session. For instance, to gain understanding of fluctuations, consistency or changes in their performance. Selected sessions are plotted side-by-side, share a common y-axis and are scrollable on the x-axis, allowing users to analyse and compare the evolution of a given variable within and between individual sessions. This allows users to, for example, identify patterns between sessions such as detecting consistently high fluctuations in heart rate over the selected sessions. Each plot has exactly two traces, where the grey colour represents the processed data from and the blue line is the data after smoothing. Figure 1.9: Individual session plots 1.7 Time in zones plots The time in zones plots 1.10 are grouped bar charts coloured by the session number, where x-axis shows the zone categories (e.g., speed zones, heart rate zones) and y-axis represents the percentage of the session spent in the zone. The plots, for example, allow summarizing and quantifying training intensity distributions by the time spent exercising in certain zones. The user can also evaluate their consistency and changes in their performance by comparing the proportion of time spent in different zones. The trackeRapp implements time in zones plots for the following variables: heart rate, speed, pace, altitude, cadence and power. In the trackeRapp the user can specify which variables to plot, as well as how many zones to split the data into. An exact percentage values are displayed by hovering over individual bars. In Figure 1.10, 4 sessions and the variables speed, heart rate and cadence were selected, each split into 6 zones. The user can see that session 13 had a lot higher intensity than the other three sessions, with a heart rate of above 155 bpm 95% of the time and cadence above 92 steps/min around 70% of the session. It appears that the user’s heart rate distribution was changing over the four sessions, with higher proportion of sessions in the 155-170 bpm zone and less time being spent in the 140-155 zone. The user can also analyse intensity by the time spent above critical power (see Frick and Kosmidis (2017)), assuming CP at 4m/s. In sessions 8,9, and 10 the athlete spent around 15-20% of the sessions above CP and around 40% above CP in session 13. Figure 1.10: Time in zones multiple sessions In order to get more detail on a particular session or sessions, the user can select which sessions to display by clicking on the legend in the top right corner of the plot, as displayed in Figure 1.11, where only session 13 was selected. Figure 1.11: Time in zones individual session 1.8 Concentration profiles plots The concentration profiles (Figure 1.12) are the negative derivative of the distribution profiles, where distribution profiles describe the time spent exercising above a threshold for a selected variable (e.g., m/s or bpm) in a given session, as defined in Kosmidis and Passfield (2015). The x-axis shows the value of the selected variable and the y-axis represents the time differential. The trackeRapp implements concentration profiles plots for the following variables: heart rate, speed, pace, altitude, cadence and power. Similar to time in zones plots, the user can specify sessions to be displayed using the legend and hovering over the lines displays the exact x-axis value. The concentration profiles can be roughly interpreted as a smoothed version of the time in zones plots. However, the interpretation of the time in zones plots are affected by the number of zones selected and can result in a loss of information and wrong understanding. On the other hand, the concentration profiles are suitable for revealing concentrations of time spent around certain values of a given variable, e.g., heart rate or speed. The shape of the concentrations profile exposes important insights about the user’s sessions. The peaks of the profile reveal the distribution’s modes, which are the concentrations of the most frequent values of the distribution, without being influenced by outliers or skewness of the distribution. For instance, a double-peaked distribution might reveal the concentration of the warm-up and cool-down speeds. The height of the concentration profile provides information on the exact time spent at different values allowing for a clear comparison between sessions. The spread of the profile shows how variable and consistent the values are in the session. For instance, a relatively narrow (small standard deviation) distribution with a distinct peak suggests a very consistent session with highly concentrated values. On the other hand, a relatively wide multimodal (no distinct peak) distribution suggests a session with high fluctuations in values. Figure 1.12: Heart rate comparison between Sessions 14 and 10 Figure 1.13: Heart rate comparison between Sessions 14 and 10 The importance of concentration profiles can be demonstrated using the same example as in Section 1.7 with the 4 selected sessions 1.10 and concentration profiles for the same four sessions (Figure 1.12). The profiles reveal that in session 13 the athlete’s heart rate is very strongly concentrated near 158-160 bpm, i.e., on the lower range of 155-170bpm range of the time in zones plot. On the other hand, session 10 is completely different, where the athlete’s heart rate is rather evenly distributed in a wider range of 140-164 bpm and reaching above 162 bpm relatively more often. Additionally, the high peak of session 13 reveals that the athletes heart rate near 158-160 bpm was sustained for a relatively long time (around 1h 15min). Figure 1.13 demonstrates the difference between sessions 13 and 10 by plotting the individual sessions. Lastly, assuming critical speed (see Section 1.9) of 4m/s, the speed of sessions 8, 9 and 10 is concentrated below the critical speed, whereas session 13 is concentrated above the critical speed. This might suggest that for an optimal training progress, the athletes intensity might be too high in session 13, or too low in the sessions 8, 9 and 10. 1.9 Work capacity plot The work capacity plots (Figure 1.14) display the amount of a finite work capacity (W’) above a critical power (CP) expended at a given time in the workout, displayed by the blue line with the grey line representing the processed data from trackeR, where the x-axis represents time and y-axis the value. CP is defined as “the maximum rate (of work) that can be kept up for a very long time without fatigue.” (Friere Skiba et al. 2012). CP is, however, often calculated as the maximum rate (of work) that can be kept for a particular period of time. For example, the Functional Threshold Power (FTP) is the CP that can be sustained for one hour . It is assumed that finite work capacity gets depleted with power output above the CP and replenished with power output below the CP. Analysis of CP and W’ expended helps athletes evaluate and personalise intensities of their workouts and maximise progress. For instance, an athlete might aim to train at &gt;121% of FTP to increase anaerobic capacity, at 56-75% of FTP to increase muscle fuel storage (endurance) or at 55% for active recovery . In order to calculate W’ for runners, power and critical power can be substituted by speed and critical speed, as suggested by Friere Skiba et al. (2012). A detailed explanation with mathematical calculations of the quantification of work capacity can be found in Frick and Kosmidis (2017). Session 10 in Figure 1.14 provides an example (assume CP at 4 m/s), where the user’s speed is well below the 4 m/s CP threshold at the beginning of the session resulting in almost no W’ expended, followed by an increased speed above the CP threshold for a short segment resulting in a steep increase in W’ expended and a subsequent reduction in speed below the CP threshold resulting in a gradual replenishment of W’ continuing until the end of the session. Figure 1.14: Work capacity 1.10 Sports identification Many athletes collect data on various sports, such as swimming, running and cycling. In order to allow the user to analyse the individual sports separately, the trackeRapp splits the users sessions by sport. The trackeRapp lets the select which sports to display as shown in Figure 1.15, where the user can select any subset of the sports and the user interface is automatically updated based on the selection. Figure 1.15: Sport classification 1.11 Changepoint detection within sessions In order to provide an athlete with insights on their consistency, deterioration or improvement of their performance throughout a session and identify weak or strong segments, the trackeRapp implements a changepoint detection algorithm to detect changes within a session for the following variables: speed, pace, heart rate, cadence running, cadence cycling and power (see example in Figure 1.16). The changepoints are detected in a given plot by clicking the Detect changepoints button in the toolbox circle in the top left corner of each plot and the detected segments in each of the selected sessions are displayed by a dark red dash lines. The changepoint detection is implemented separately for all of the variables available in the users dataset. The user is able to select the maximum number of changepoints to search for in a session. This provides the flexibility to limit the number of segments to only detect, for example, the two most important changes in the session. For instance, in Figure ?? the maximum number of changepoints is set to two changes for heart rate and four changes for speed. However, the algorithm might detect fewer segments than the maximum set by the user due to the penalty measure implemented, in order to avoid over-fitting. By providing the option to set the maximum number of changepoints, the user is able to set a reasonable maximum number after observing the shape of the data.

The trackeRapp then automatically merges all the sessions after processing raw files. The trackeRapp removes any duplicated sessions that might occur. This allows the user to constantly add new raw sessions and merge those with previous already processed sessions without any repeated calculations. 2.1.1 Upload raw data Raw data is defined as data from a GPS-enabled tracking device saved in a common format. The trackeRapp package supports reading files in the following formats: TCX, GPX, JSON and DB3. 2.1.2 Upload processed data Processed data is a file in an rds format, which is a trackeRdata object generated using the R programming language. It is also the file that is generated if a user downloads the processed data through the trackeRapp. The user can upload the downloaded processed file to the trackeRapp allowing to save processing time. 2.2 Download data In order for the user to avoid re-processing the same raw data file each time they use the interface, the trackeRapp enables downloading the processed data by clicking on the Download processed data button. The downloaded file is in an rds format and named using the current date (e.g., “trackeRapp_data-2018-02-18.RData”). The user can upload the downloaded file next time they use the trackeRapp, as well as for analysis in R using the trackeR package (Frick and Kosmidis (2017)). 2.3 Session selection The workout timeline (1.1), the session summaries plots (1.5), the map (1.4), the sport identification ( 1.15) and the summary table of selected sessions (1.3) all enable the selection of sessions. The user is able to select sessions in the plots in two ways - a box and lasso selection. The box selection selects sessions using a rectangular box of any size and all the sessions within the box will be selected. Lasso selection is very useful when the user wants to select specific sessions. These methods allow comparison and analysis of any sessions of interest. Session selection can be reset by cliking the Reset session selection button at the top of the page. The session selection methods are demonstrated in the video below. 2.4 Select variables to plot The trackeRapp lets the user adjust the interface by selecting which variables to plot. The user is able to change the selection at any point and the interface automatically updates. 2.5 Change units The user is often interested in displaying their data in various units of measurement and so the trackeRapp was designed for the user to be able to display and change the units of measurement of any of the variables at any point whilst using trackeRapp. All the plots and summaries are automatically updated once the Apply button is clicked. The modal dialog interface with radio buttons was designed to clearly display which units of measurement are currently selected, as well as all the other units of measurement available for each variable. 2.6 Changepoint detection As explained in Section 1.11, the user is able to detect changes within a session for the available variables.
