        abstract = {A multiplicative effects model is introduced for the identification of the factors that are influential to the performance of highly-trained endurance runners. The model extends the established power-law relationship between performance times and distances by taking into account the effect of the physiological status of the runners, and training effects extracted from GPS records collected over the course of a year. In order to incorporate information on the runners' training into the model, the concept of the training distribution profile is introduced and its ability to capture the characteristics of the training session is discussed. The covariates that are relevant to runner performance as response are identified using a procedure termed multi-resolution elastic net. Multi-resolution elastic net allows the simultaneous identification of scalar covariates and of intervals on the domain of one or more functional covariates that are most influential for the response. The results identify a contiguous group of speed intervals between 5.3 to 5.7 m{$\cdot$}s?1 as influential for the improvement of running performance and extend established relationships between physiological status and runner performance. Another outcome of multi-resolution elastic net is a predictive equation for performance based on the minimization of the mean squared prediction error on a test data set across resolutions.}

 abstract = {It is sometimes useful in an analysis of variance to split the treatments into reasonably homogeneous groups. Multiple comparison procedures are often used for this purpose, but a more direct method is to use the techniques of cluster analysis. This approach is illustrated for several sets of data, and a likelihood ratio test is developed for judging the significance of differences among the resulting groups.},
