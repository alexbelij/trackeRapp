# The trackeRapp

The goal of the
[**trackeRapp**](https://trackerapp.com) is to
provide an integrated workflow and a web interface for the analysis of sports
data from GPS-enabled tracking devices. The **trackeRapp** is a platform with flexible and extensive
visualisation and analysis tools. It has a user friendly, intuitive and
adjustable interface and it was developed open-source on top of the
[**trackeR**](https://github.com/trackerproject/trackeR) package. The
interface was fully built using the **shiny** package.


## Installation

You can install the **trackeRapp** from CRAN:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages('trackeRapp')
```

You can also install the **trackeRapp** from github with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("trackerproject/trackeRapp")
```

## Getting started

Please see the [**tour de
trackeRapp**](https://trackerproject.github.io/trackeRapp/) to learn about the **trackeRapp** and all its capabilities, including many tutorial videos and visualisations. The following are screenshots from the **trackeRapp** web interface:

```{r out.width='95%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Session summaries', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('README_files/evening_sessions.png')
```

```{r out.width='95%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('README_files/map.png')
```

<br>

```{r out.width='95%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('README_files/session_summaries.png')
```


<br>

```{r out.width='95%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Time in zones', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('README_files/zones_multiple_sessions.png')
```

## Example

A user can access the web interface remotely at <https://www.trackerapp.com> or on their local machine by running the
following commands:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
# Load the package
library(trackeRapp)
# Open the interface in the browser
trackeR_app()
```
