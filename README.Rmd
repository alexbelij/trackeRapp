# trackeRapp

[**trackeRapp**](https://trackerapp.com) is a
[**shiny**](http://shiny.rstudio.com) interface for the analysis and
tracking of athletic activity data in R.

**trackeRapp** builds on the extensive infrastructure provided by the
[**trackeR**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=trackeR) R package
and offers a user-friendly web-interface that implements an integrated
workflow for the analysis of running, cycling and swimming data from
GPS-enabled tracking devices through flexible and extensive
interactive visualisations and data-analytic tools. **trackeRapp**
offers functionality to import data from raw activity files of popular
formats (tcx, gpx, json and db3), clean them, organised them and
finally export images of processed activity data that can be used for
further analysis not only within *trackeRapp* but also for more
advanced modelling in R.

## Installation

You can install **trackeRapp** from CRAN by typing

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("trackeRapp")
```

You can also install the development version of **trackeRapp** from github by doing

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("trackerproject/trackeRapp")
```

## Getting started

Please see the [**tour de trackeRapp**](https://trackerproject.github.io/trackeRapp/) pages for tutorial videos, explanation of the visualisations, and to learn more about **trackeRapp** and all of its capabilities.

Below are just a few screenshots from the **trackeRapp** web interface
